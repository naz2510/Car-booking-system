This project is a basic Car Booking System implemented in C. It allows users to perform various operations related to car models and bookings through a menu-driven interface. Let's break down the components of the project and then suggest possible names for it.

Project Overview
Functionality:

Add New Model (addModel()): Allows the user to add a new car model to the system. It records the model ID, car name, and current date.

Car Model List (modelList()): Displays a list of available car models stored in the file cars.txt, including model ID, car name, and date added.

Remove Car Model (del()): Deletes a car model based on the provided model ID. It reads data from cars.txt, removes the specified model, and updates the file.

Book Car (carBooking()): Enables booking of a car model by a customer. It checks if the specified model ID exists, prompts for customer details (name, address, phone number), and records the booking in issue.txt.

Booked Car List (bookedList()): Displays a list of booked cars along with customer details (name, address, phone number), car name, and booking date. Data is read from issue.txt.

Remove Booking (cdel()): Allows removal of a booking based on customer name. It reads data from issue.txt, removes the booking record for the specified customer, and updates the file.
